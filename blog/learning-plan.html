      <h1>My Learning Plan - Bootcamp</h1>
      <h2>What is my long-term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
      <p>
        My long-term goal hasn't changed. I would still like to become a
        competent ethical hacker or cybersecurity specialist. Although I don't
        know if the technical skills I'll learn through Dev Academy will
        directly aid this endevour, the core/soft skills, definitely will.
      </p>
      <h2>
        What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in
        Bootcamp?
      </h2>
      <h3><em>Strengths:</em></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I believe my communication skills and ability to work well in a team
          will do a lot for me during Bootcamp. I can't go for ages and ages in
          a team environment, as I sometimes need to sit down and have a crack
          at problems on my own. But whenever I do work alongside others, I
          thrive.
        </li>
        <li>
          I have come to reasess my previous statement of being a "fast
          learner". Where I do think that's true in some instances where I
          breeze through work, in others, it takes me quite some time to learn.
          I do think at a base level, I can keep at a comfortable pace, in sink
          with my fellow students.
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            I find it generally easy to remain dedicated and focused as long as
            I start - Where this statement is still true, I do think it's
            'caused by' and fits into a wider context: This being when I'm
            "living in the moment".
          </p>
          <p>
            One of my biggest weaknesses has been that I live in my head a lot.
            Whenever I'm constantly analyzing and overanalyzing everything, I
            loose focus on "what's important now". This of course, causes a lot
            of stress, and sometimes procrastination, as I'm afraid of even
            starting when there is so much to do. Just chucking that mentality
            out the window and focusing on W.I.N. - What's Important
            <strong>Now</strong> (My Uncle coined this term) has really helped
            me 're-shift' my priorities, and sharpen my focus.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3><em>Weaknesses:</em></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          As I've highlighted in my 'strengths' section, I do struggle with
          focus, and prioritization of time, whenever I overanalyze things. This
          is something I'm trying to change and avoid at all costs.
        </li>
        <li>
          Part of overthinking things has led to me to doubt myself and my
          learning abilities. I often get bogged down, worrying about if I've
          learned enough, frantically scrambling to write everything down in
          notes. I sometimes struggle to trust myself, the process, and the fact
          that I need to just 'practice, practice, practice'.
        </li>
        <li>
          I can get distracted if I don't remain focused and disciplined. -
          Again, this ties into my tendancy of living in my head, 'fearing' what
          is to come and the anxiety that causes.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>
        What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will
        be?
      </h2>
      <p>
        These might currently just be fears I have about Bootcamp, but I do
        think these are areas that may turn out to be challenging for me:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Keeping in pace with everyone else i.e. not falling behind. As a part
          of my weaknesses, overanalyzing things, making too many notes may lead
          me to falling behind. It may prove challengeing for me to figure out
          how to engage with the lecture material in a way that doesn't slow me
          down more than it aids my learning.
          <em
            >To anyone reading this, if you have any recommendations on how to
            get over this, notetaking methods that can help during lectures
            etc., please get in contact with me, I'd highly appreciate it.
          </em>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Burning out. I worry that due to the intensity of the course, I may
            get burned out early on, negating my ability to focus and engage
            with the course material.
          </p>
          <p>
            In other words, It may prove challenging for me to keep on top of
            the workload, and keep myself dedicated and focused, especially when
            I'm tired.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Taking a leadership role in a team: Although I work very well in a
          team, I haven't really been exposed to many situations where I'm
          required to actually 'lead' a team. This is something that may be very
          challenging for me.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>
        What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h2>
      <p>Just everything I've talked about so far really.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>My leadership skills</li>
        <li>My self-discipline</li>
        <li>
          My ability to engage with and study coursework, effectively. i.e my
          organization skills.
        </li>
        <li>My confidence in myself and the abilities I build up over time.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h2>
      <p>
        Just to give feedback on my progress whenever possible. Things can get
        confusing sometimes, and being able to know if what you have learned so
        far is sufficient to move on with, is increadibly helpful. For me
        personally, this has/will help with understanding of when to go into
        more detail on topics and when it's time to move on.
      </p>
      <h2>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h2>
      <h3>
        <em
          >Based on your knowledge of Bootcamp, how and where will you seek help
          in a timely way?</em
        >
      </h3>
      <p>
        I will seek help from my fellow students/teachers whenever
        possible/appropriate
      </p>
      <h3><em>My commitment</em></h3>
      <p>
        I will strive to remain focused and disciplined at all times, keeping in
        touch with my fascilitators about my progress as much as possible. To
        work safely and productively with others, I will remain respectful,
        honest, patient and diligent in my approach to teamwork, and study in
        general.

      <h1>My Learning Plan - Foundations</h1>
      <h2>What is my long-term goal or career pathway?</h2>
      <p>
        My long-term goal would be to become a competent ethical hacker or
        cybersecurity specialist.
      </p>
      <h2>What are my strenghts and limitations when it comes to learning?</h2>
      <h3><em>Strengths:</em></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I am a fast learner. I can pick up things reasonably quickly with
          practice. The more practice the better.
        </li>
        <li>I have good communication skills and can work well in a team</li>
        <li>
          I find it generally easy to remain dedicated and focused as long as I
          start.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3><em>Weaknesses:</em></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I have a tendency of going into too much detail on topics and jumping
          down rabbit holes that steal my time.
        </li>
        <li>
          I tend to overthink things which often leads to unnecessary time being
          wasted.
        </li>
        <li>I can get distracted if I don’t remain focused and disciplined.</li>
        <li>I sometimes bite off more than I can chew.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The 'core' skills I would like to see developed at Dev Academy:</h2>
      <p>
        First and foremost, I would like to improve my self-discipline. Although
        it has improved over the years, I want it to be something I'm gunuinely
        proud of.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another thing I would like to see developed is my problem-solving
        skills. Due to overcomplicating things, it becomes hard for me to
        discern between when I'm going down a needless rabbit hole or when I am
        genuinely stuck. This is where I've needed to rely on my problem-solving
        ability the most, instead of my general ablitity to remember things, and
        its something I would like to develop as much as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lastly, something I would like developed is my confidence. Not only as a
        developer, but in myself and my abilities.
      </p>
      <h2>
        My commitment as to how I will manage my workload in this programme:
      </h2>
      <p>
        I will manage myself in a professional manner, doing my best with
        regards to progressing my learning, while treating those around me with
        kindness and respect. If things start building up, I will remain calm,
        reassess and keep trying. If I need help, I will seek advice from my
        cohort or my teachers if and when available, in a timely and
        professional manner.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will use time managing apps to assist me through each step of the way,
        and set goals to complete for each upcoming lesson.
      </p>
      <h2>What I would like to see from the Facilitation team:</h2>
      <p>
        If I can continue to be treated with the same patience and kindness as
        I’ve experienced from the team at DevAcademy so far, I would be very
        grateful.
      </p>
      <h2>Important commitments ('block-out' times):</h2>
      <p>
        Going to church on Sundays is very important to me so from about 8:30am
        to 1:30pm I won’t be available.
