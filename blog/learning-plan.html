    <h1>Cultural Blog - My Learning Plan</h1>
    <h2>What is my long-term goal or career pathway?</h2>
    <p>
      My long-term goal would be to become a competent ethical hacker or
      cybersecurity specialist.
    </p>
    <h2>What are my strenghts and limitations when it comes to learning?</h2>
    <h3><em>Strengths:</em></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I am a fast learner. I can pick up things reasonably quickly with
        practice. The more practice the better.
      </li>
      <li>I have good communication skills and can work well in a team</li>
      <li>
        I find it generally easy to remain dedicated and focused as long as I
        start.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3><em>Weaknesses:</em></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I have a tendency of going into too much detail on topics and jumping
        down rabbit holes that steal my time.
      </li>
      <li>
        I tend to overthink things which often leads to unnecessary time being
        wasted.
      </li>
      <li>I can get distracted if I don’t remain focused and disciplined.</li>
      <li>I sometimes bite off more than I can chew.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The 'core' skills I would like to see developed at Dev Academy:</h2>
    <p>
      First and foremost, I would like to improve my self-discipline. Although
      it has improved over the years, I want it to be something I'm gunuinely
      proud of.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another thing I would like to see developed is my problem-solving skills.
      Due to overcomplicating things, it becomes hard for me to discern between
      when I'm going down a needless rabbit hole or when I am genuinely stuck.
      This is where I've needed to rely on my problem-solving ability the most,
      instead of my general ablitity to remember things, and its something I
      would like to develop as much as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, something I would like developed is my confidence. Not only as a
      developer, but in myself and my abilities.
    </p>
    <h2>
      My commitment as to how I will manage my workload in this programme:
    </h2>
    <p>
      I will manage myself in a professional manner, doing my best with regards
      to progressing my learning, while treating those around me with kindness
      and respect. If things start building up, I will remain calm, reassess and
      keep trying. If I need help, I will seek advice from my cohort or my
      teachers if and when available, in a timely and professional manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will use time managing apps to assist me through each step of the way,
      and set goals to complete for each upcoming lesson.
    </p>
    <h2>What I would like to see from the Facilitation team:</h2>
    <p>
      If I can continue to be treated with the same patience and kindness as
      I’ve experienced from the team at DevAcademy so far, I would be very
      grateful.
    </p>
    <h2>Important commitments ('block-out' times):</h2>
    <p>
      Going to church on Sundays is very important to me so from about 8:30am to
      1:30pm I won’t be available.
