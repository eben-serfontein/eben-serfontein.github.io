      <h2>Here are a few examples of times I:</h2>
      <h3>1. Was blocked on a simple problem:</h3>
      <p>
        The last time I’ve truly gotten stuck on something was just a few days
        ago, during the Built-In Methods part of the course.
      </p>
      <p>
        In one of the problems, you are given a string of words, for which you
        need to capitalize the first characters of all the words, and return the
        string with the new changes. Although this seemed simple on paper, and I
        had a basic idea of what I was doing, I struggled a lot to actually get
        the first character of the words in question and how to combine those
        characters with the remainders of their corresponding words. It became
        very clear to me that I had a pretty sizable gap in my knowledge and
        after a few stressful minutes of confused “caveman-like” “huh?’s” and
        “uh?’s”, I decided to consult good ‘ol google for answers. Just a few
        minutes later and I found what I needed to proceed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although I felt very stupid during all this, and admittedly, did get
        demotivated a few times, I did learn a lot, and really got to test my
        problem-solving skills. My struggles led to a deeper understanding of
        how methods work, the correlation between arrays, strings and their
        methods, and generally how to approach a daunting problem.
      </p>
      <h3>2. Elegantly solved a problem.</h3>
      <p>
        As the last example involved a lot of under breath swearing, and
        confused caveman like ‘ungha bungas’ I wouldn’t exactly have called it
        “elegant”. A better example would be the very next problem I solved in
        that rep.it:
      </p>
      <p>
        Having had my confidence restored with the last victory, I approached
        the next question with a lot more gusto and equanimity. Flying through
        the first part of it, I used my newly gained knowledge from the previous
        problem to full effect. This quickly came to an end however, as I once
        again got stuck on a problem I had no idea of how to solve. This time,
        with a combination of google searches and scrolling through the
        Dev-Academy discord for help, I soon found a solution.
      </p>
      <p>
        Being a lot more calm this time, I ended up with a lot more confidence
        and a lot less time spent frantically searching for answers. Besides the
        new technical knowledge I gained, I learned a lot in regards to dealing
        with stress, and calmly finding answers to problems.
      </p>
      <h2>
        My confidence in regards to each of these problem-solving
        techniques/processes:
      </h2>
      <h3>Pseudocode</h3>
      <p>
        Although I am not completely sure of what universally accepted structure
        to use as of yet, (if such a thing even exists), I am quite confident in
        my ability to lay out problems in pseudocode, and utilize it as a key
        component to my problem-solving process.
      </p>
      <h3>Trying something</h3>
      <p>
        Well, I mean… My entire process up to this point has been trying
        different things to see if they work. I am pretty sure you’re doing
        something wrong if you don’t try a bunch of different things to get to a
        solution. So yes I am very confident with this.
      </p>
      <h3>Rubber ducky method</h3>
      <p>
        I have actually been using this a lot more than I thought I would. I was
        quite surprised when I first learned what the Rubber Ducky method is and
        had quite a laugh reading some of the articles people have posted on the
        subject. Even if it seems a little bit ‘out-there’ it makes a lot of
        sense as to why it works, and it has changed my perspective on
        problem-solving as a whole.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is very easy to get stuck on one particular detail of a problem, and
        focus so hard on that one aspect, that you completely lose sight of the
        bigger picture. Just stepping away, explaining something step by step,
        fully, has really helped me find quick answers, where I otherwise would
        have been stuck and frustrated for a long time.
      </p>
      <h3>Reading error messages</h3>
      <p>
        I’m not going to lie, these have been very daunting at the start of my
        coding journey. You just see this big scary wall of red text and start
        audibly gulping as you ponder all the massive mistakes this gleaming
        beacon of ‘err’ must be pointing to. Actually understanding now, not
        only what they are representing, but also the fact that they are
        actually there to help, has really bolstered my confidence.
      </p>
      <h3>Console.logging</h3>
      <p>
        I honestly use this so, so much. Just being able to open a little window
        into what your code is doing at any given point, is one of, if not the
        most helpful things I've learned when it comes to problem solving.
      </p>
      <h3>Googling</h3>
      <p>
        Ah yes, good ‘ol google. Not gonna lie, if google was an actual person,
        I would either be their best friend, or biggest annoyance. I’ve been
        using google a lot for solving problems, and I feel very confident in
        using it to find solutions.
      </p>
      <h3>Asking your peers for help</h3>
      <p>
        I admittedly haven’t been doing this super often, as I usually find what
        I need from google. But whenever I can’t find any answers, or perhaps
        need a fresh perspective on a problem, I immediately reach out to my
        fellow cohort members for help.
      </p>
      <h3>Asking coaches for help</h3>
      <p>
        I don’t do this too often, but I have no problem doing it if need be. I
        have asked one of my facilitators a few core related questions in my
        reflections, which she has been super awesome in helping me with.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are reading this Mere, thank you again so much, you are an
        absolute legend!
      </p>
      <h3>Improving your process with reflection</h3>
      <p>
        This is something I've come to rely on more and more during my time here
        at Dev-Academy and it has proven to be an absolutely irreplaceable part
        of my learning process.
