      <h2>What is neuroplasticity and how can it benefit you?</h2>
      <p>
        Understanding how neuroplasticity works can have a massive impact, not
        only on how you perceive yourself, but how you engage with the world
        around you.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the longest time I’ve viewed myself as being incapable of change,
        wholeheartedly believing that the negative preconceived notions I had
        about myself where not only true, but unchangeable aspects of my
        identity and inner being. This only led to a sea of self-doubt,
        self-loathing, and depression, exasperated by the insecurity and
        inaction that comes from such a mindset.
      </p>
      <p>
        Understanding neuroplasticity is understanding the fact that your
        capabilities at this very moment, aren’t ‘locked’ or limited by your
        genetics. There isn’t some ‘magical force’ deciding what you can and
        can’t do. Grasping this essential concept, not only brings power and
        meaning back to your actions, but leads to an overall better outlook on
        the world and your future as a whole.
      </p>
      <h2>How do you increase neuroplasticity then?</h2>
      <p>
        There are several factors that can increase neuroplasticity, such as
        sleep and exercise, but the most important one of all is practice.
      </p>
      <p>
        The human brain consists of these vastly complicated, interconnected
        neuron ‘information highways’. The more ‘traffic’ travels between these
        neuron highways, i.e. the more you practice a certain skill, the bigger
        those information roadways become. This basically means, the more you
        practice, the better you become. This vastly contradicts the more
        traditional ‘fixed’ mindset viewpoint, as pretty much anything you put
        your mind to, you can get better at.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is why, and it’s something I’ve come to realize quite recently,
        it’s so important to practice, practice, practice. Not just looking or
        listening, but actually doing, as much as possible, is what leads to the
        fastest increase of skill, memory, and proficiency in a specific area.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here’s a good article I found on the topic, I highly suggest you give it
        a look:

      <h2>What is a Growth Mindset and why is it relevant?</h2>
      <p>
        Having a growth mindset is so, so important. With a fixed mindset any
        failure becomes a direct prod at one’s own character. Since you
        supposedly can’t change at all, failure becomes something to be avoided
        at all costs. Not only does this stunt any capacity for growth, it
        cultivates this almost fight or flight mentality where it feels like the
        entire world is out to get you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now contrast this with a growth mindset. Here you look forward to
        failure, as you know that every failure isn’t a reflection of your
        character, but an opportunity to learn and move forward.
      </p>
      <p>
        This quote from <em>Carol Dwek</em>, hits home on this point quite
        nicely:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em
          >Why waste time proving over and over how great you are, when you
          could be getting better? Why hide deficiencies instead of overcoming
          them?</em
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        A growth mindset forces you to look at the world more positively, not
        fearing your failures, but seeing them for what they really are:
        Opportunities to grow, learn, and improve.
      </p>

      <h3>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h3>
      <p>
        This has been very helpful for me personally, as I’ve had a very
        negative view of myself for a long time. I never thought I had the
        capacity for growth, and I very much tried to avoid failure as much as I
        could. In the end this just led me to cultivating self-deprecating and
        self-isolating behaviours. In the last few years, doing things like
        working for Gallagher, something I never thought possible for old Eben
        to do, let alone excel at, really bolstered my confidence and changed
        the way I looked at myself and my prospects. This, combined with
        everything I’ve learned so far at Dev-Academy has really solidified this
        change in perspective in me, and it’s something I will be grateful for,
        for the rest of my life.
      </p>
      <h3>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h3>
      <p>
        I will continue to focus on self-improvement, not beating myself up
        every time I fail like I used to. I will look forward with the
        understanding that through each failure, I move forward and improve just
        a little bit.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your
        learning plan and strategy.
      </h3>
      <p>
        For the most part, this has changed the way I look at myself, and how I
        approach challenges. I will try and incorporate this knowledge more and
        more into my learning journey.
      </p>
      <p>
        Something I’ve already started in this regard is switching over from a
        more traditional ‘school based’ ‘knowledge cramming’ methodology, to a
        more practice-based way of learning. It’s become quite apparent to me
        that trying to remember things isn’t the most effective way for our
        brains to learn. Practicing should be at the forefront, as, in regards
        to neuroplasticity, it’s the absolute best way to learn.
