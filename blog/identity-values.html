    <h1>My Ethics, Values and Strengths</h1>
    <h2>
      Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how
      you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you
      made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
    </h2>
    <p>
      While working for Gallagher group back in 2021, I found myself in a little
      bit of an ethical dilemma. Gallagher is very focused on efficiency, and
      quality, with staff monitoring our progress throughout the day with time
      sheets.
    </p>
    <p>
      At one point I was given the opportunity to work in a particularly more
      “technology” based department, made up of only a handful of people
      including myself. By being in a smaller building outside of the main
      working area, we weren’t really monitored that much and were asked to fill
      in the time sheets ourselves. After finishing my training, I was now
      responsible for filling in my own time sheet and was quickly whisked away
      by one of the guys. He told me to only write 100% in my time sheet and to
      not tell anyone that I’m doing this. Because of the fact we were working
      with large quantities of product, it was very difficult if not impossible
      to track our hourly progress throughout the day, making the time-sheets
      useless. I didn’t know if I’d get the guys in trouble for speaking up, and
      that genuinely frightened me. On one hand, I don’t think they were being
      lazy, but it wasn’t a very honest way of operating. After thinking about
      the issue thoroughly, I decided to consult a senior team-member from one
      of the other departments on what to do. We discussed the situation
      thoroughly, and I proposed the creation of a batch-based time-sheet which
      would actually allow me and my team to track our progress throughout the
      day. He thought it was a great idea, and after taking it to my Manager,
      plans were put in place to implement it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking back on the decision, I am very happy how it turned out. I just
      wish I wasn’t so frightened at speaking up initially.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your
      values and identity.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Growing up in a Christian family has surely shaped my values and identity
      a lot. Things like, humility, respecting people, being polite at all times
      were taught to me at a young age, and are values I still hold dear today.
      My identity was very much influenced by my dad particularly, who I had a
      lot of respect for growing up. He’s always been somebody I’ve been able to
      look up to and learn from, and I can’t thank him enough for the countless
      valuable lesson’s he’s taught me. When it comes to culture, I find it very
      difficult to pinpoint which one I relate to the most. Having moved to NZ
      from South Africa at a young age, I never really got the chance to grow up
      in that culture, and still can’t really identify with it. This might very
      well be something subconscious that I’ve inherited from my parents, but I
      can’t really place my finger on exactly what it is. Whatever the outcome,
      I am very grateful for my roots, the people I’ve been blessed with, and
      the lessons I’ve learned.

      Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning

    <ul>
      <li>
        Even although I work at my best alone, I can do very well in a team
        environment as well, and love learning alongside others.
      </li>
      <li>
        My learning method thus-far has mainly centred around ‘remembering’
        ideas and concepts as best as possible, but with html and css having so
        much to them, I’ve had to shift to a more ‘practice’ based learning
        method. I was hesitant at first as its new territory, but I’ve come to
        find that I actually learn very well this way. The more practice I put
        in the easier it is for me to remember things.
      </li>
      <li>
        I find it easy to remain dedicated and focused when I eliminate any and
        all distractions.

    </ul>
    <h2>
      Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
      development. How might these affect your learning journey?
    </h2>
    <p>
      I overthink things a lot, and its proven difficult for me to just
      ‘practice’ instead of cramming my brain full of information. I’ve also
      discovered an issue with 'initial' motivation, causing me to procrastinate
      instead of just starting.
    </p>

      Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others,
      but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the
      time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other
      strategies you would try now and why.
    </h2>
    <p>
      While at Gallagher, teams usually consisted of around 3 to 4 people.
      Everyone needs to work together at their best. If even just one person
      slows down, it affects everyone else in the team. Sometimes, especially
      with people still learning the jobs, it was very difficult to keep a
      consistent pace due to someone slowing down. In these situations, whenever
      possible, I completed parts of that person’s task in order to help take
      the load off them and the team. Additionally, when they got stuck or
      couldn’t figure out how something worked, I tried my best to help them
      understand. Other times someone’s just having a bad day. In those cases, I
      found just being there, talking, and offering some encouragement, went a
      long way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Often, I found that people new to the job didn’t know how to set up their
      workspace to be as effective as possible. Everyone kind of learns their
      quirks and how they like it along the way, but there are basic things that
      I learned that could help a lot, that I didn’t share. It didn’t seem that
      important to me at the time, but in hindsight, this should have been one
      of my strategies.
