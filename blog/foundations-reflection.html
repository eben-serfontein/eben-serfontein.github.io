    <h1>Reflecting on this amazing journey so far</h1>
    <h2>
      What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due
      to the core learning?
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. That I am in my head a lot. I put this one first as I believe it's one
      of the most important things I've come to realise about myself. By
      practicing the mindfullness excercises, I came to fully appreciate just
      how much I tend to live in my head, not focusing on living every moment to
      the best of my ability. This has led to a lot of stress and anxiety, as
      I'm always fretting about what needs to be done, always thinking about
      what can go wrong. I've come to learn to just live in the current moment
      as best I can, not worrying about future things I can't immediately
      change. This has drastically improved my overall happiness, confidence,
      and ability to complete seemingly "impossible" tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. In regards to my ego, it has been practically non-existent for a long
      time. This is technically a good thing, but by virtue of it having caused
      me to not trust myself in anything, it has proven to be a great detrement.
      By not having any confidence in myself, I've completely avoided pushing
      myself and actually testing my limits, in the fear that I may fail.
      Because of my mindset being very fixed and negative, any fault I made, I
      directly associated with my self-worth. Learning about neuroplasticity and
      really understanding that hey, "failing doesn't mean you're useless, it
      means you are learning" has really strengthened me as a person.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. And lastly, I've learned to trust myself more. I've realized that the
      only thing stopping me from achieving things that are seemingly
      impossible, is quite simply; "myself". There is no invisible force
      stopping me, nor some magical power that decided that I'm not smart enough
      or something. What I put in is what I get out, as simple as that.
    </p>
    <h2>
      What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
      programming?
    </h2>
    <p>
      In learning, they help you understand what makes you tick, your strengths
      etc., and how you can use them to benefit others. By having strong moral
      values, you become someone who can be trusted and relied apon and by
      having empathy, you become approachable and easy to work with. These are
      essential skills to build up as they differentiate between what makes a
      programmer 'good' and what makes a programmer 'amazing'.
    </p>
    <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
    <p>
      How much of an impact this has on my life... I mean these are some
      incredibly important concepts, that range from understanding yourself
      better, all the way to how to live optimally mentally. I have learned so
      much so far, and have gained crucial knowledge that I reference every
      single day.
    </p>
    <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
    <p>
      The two things I grappled with the most were EQ/IQ and how they factor
      into programming, and conscious listening (living in the moment).
    </p>
    <p>
      It was quite shocking for me to learn that employers are actually looking
      for soft skills, not pure knowledge. Where knowing a lot of the actual
      programming side of things certainly helps, if you aren't easy to work
      with, those skills go underutilized.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another thing for me was, understanding the importance of mindfullness and
      living in the moment. Not fretting over the future and causing undue worry
      and stress. If you can focus on mastering every minute, instead of
      worrying about everything that needs to happen, you'll be much better off.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
      focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Because it is important. At the start, I didn't really understand what the
      deal was with focusing so much on core, but I soon came to realize that
      the biggest part of being a web developer isn't pure technical knowledge,
      it's tenacity, drive, values. Soft skills that pilot your learning.
      Building these up is almost just as important, if not more important than
      learning the code itself.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of
      time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead?
      Justify your answer.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Hell no! Pardon my bluntness, but if core wasn't a thing, I wouldn't have
      understood things like: How a positive mindset aids learning. How failure
      actually ties in to effective learning. And I would still have had my
      previous view on 'memorization' instead of 'practice'. These are just a
      handful of essential skills I've learned that have not only improved my
      outlook on life, but my approach to programming as a whole.
