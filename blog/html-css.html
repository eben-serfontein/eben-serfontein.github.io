      <h2>What is a Margin?</h2>

      <div>
        <p>
          Imagine this is you. “You have written out your code and have been
          trying to get that pesky little image, text or box to just mind its
          own business and stop being so close to your other elements? What do
          you do? Well, that is where the margin property comes in.
        </p>
        <p>Look at the following example:</p>
        <p>
          Let's say we have a few paragraph tags with some text in them, and we
          want to increase or decrease the distance between each of these
          paragraphs:
        </p>

        <img src="Resources/random-text.JPG" alt="some random text" />

        <p>
          To do this we use the p selector (this tells CSS that you want to
          style all your p or 'paragraph' elements). Under it specify the
          "margin" property and set it to 100px (as a random value):
        </p>
        <img src="Resources/margin-1.JPG" alt="margin property example" />
        <p>
          As you can see, the distance between the text changed drastically:
        </p>

        <img
          src="Resources/100px.JPG"
          alt="random text but with greater distance between them"
        />

        <p>
          Margin controls the space between all your elements. Changing the
          number of px (pixels) you want between your elements, will increase
          and decrease this space. If you want to be more specific, you can
          specify margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom, and margin-left:
        </p>

        <p>
          This allows you to adjust the margin for only the space above, to the
          right, below, or left of your elements. Alternatively, you can do the
          same by just typing margin and the px values you want in a clockwise
          fashion:
        </p>

        <p>
          It goes in this order: top, right, bottom, left. Just like a clock!
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>What is Padding?</h2>

      <p>
        Now, unlike margin, padding does not change the distance between
        elements. Instead, it changes the distance between elements and their
        content (what is inside them).
      </p>

      <p>
        Using the border property will create a border around your content and
        allow you to see this in action, but I couldn't get it to work fast
        enough. You can't see it, but padding is affecting the distance between
        the text and its 'invisible' border:
      </p>

      <img
        src="Resources/border-and-padding.JPG"
        alt="example of border and padding"
      />

      <p>
        By increasing or decreasing the padding, we effectively increase and
        decrease the space between our elements and the border around them. It
        uses the exact same “clockwise” fashion as the margin property does, so
        we can specify exactly which side of our elements we want padded.
      </p>

      <p>I hope this was helpful.</p>
