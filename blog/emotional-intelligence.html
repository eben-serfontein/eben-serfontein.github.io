      <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
      <p>
        Emotional intelligence refers to a person’s ability to identify, assess,
        control, and express their own emotions. People with high EQ are more
        self-aware, empathetic, responsible and socially apt. This awareness of
        one’s own strengths and limitations, leads to a high level of
        motivation, drive and thirst for personal improvement and achievement.
      </p>
      <h3>How is it different to IQ?</h3>
      <p>
        Where IQ is focused on aspects of intelligence relating to academic
        success, such as reasoning, memory, visual and processing skills, EQ is
        more focused on emotional and interpersonal ‘perception’ and regulation.
        A good way of looking at it is that IQ is “book smarts” and that EQ is
        “street smarts”.
      </p>
      <h3>Why is it important?</h3>
      <p>
        EQ is important for multiple reasons, one of the main ones being
        personal success. A person with a high EQ is more likely to do well in
        leadership roles, can handle responsibilities better, and in general,
        are more secure and happy with their lives. This confidence and
        happiness results in more approachable, understandable and relatable
        people, who are easy to confide in and trust.
